# To-be analysis

The To-be analysis is focused on the analysis of the proposed state. The to-be analysis uses BPMN as a tool to capture the state of the Tax administration process after the completion of the digitization. To show the state the detailed [BPMN model](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/to-be-analysis/BPMN_level_2.png) is presented.
