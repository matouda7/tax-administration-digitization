# As-is analysis

The As-is analysis focuses on the current state of the tax administration process. DEMO is used as a tool to reveal and capture the essence of the process as defined in the Czech code of law.

## OER analysis

The OER analysis is used to reveal the process activities, constructs, and actors. It consists of four steps, and the output is presented in the [oer-analysis](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/tree/main/as-is-analysis/oer-analysis) directory. The result of [step one](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/oer-analysis/OER-Step1.pdf) is the highlighted text of the Czech code of law. During [step two]( https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/oer-analysis/OER-Step2.pdf), the transaction kinds and actor roles are identified (e-TRT and Subject-Actor table are used to summarize the found transactions and actors). [Step three]( https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/oer-analysis/OER-Step3.pdf) consists of composing the essential model â€“ Interaction Structure Diagram, in this case. The fourth step is based on the validation of the previous steps (that's why the directory contains only three files).

## DEMO models

To capture the essence of the tax administration process, the [CSD](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/demo-models/coordination_structure_diagram.pdf) and [OFD](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/demo-models/object_fact_diagram.pdf) are used. The models are shown in the [demo-models](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/tree/main/as-is-analysis/demo-models) directory.
