# As-is analysis

The As-is analysis is focused on the analysis of the current state. The as-is analysis uses DEMO as a tool to reveal and capture the essence of the Tax administration process defined in the Czech code of law.

## OER analysis

To reveal the process activities, constructs, and actors the OER analysis is used. The OER analysis consists of four steps, which outputs is presented in the [oer-analysis](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/tree/main/as-is-analysis/oer-analysis) directory.  The result of the [step one](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/oer-analysis/OER-Step1.pdf) is highlighted text of the Czech code of law. During the [step two]( https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/oer-analysis/OER-Step2.pdf) the transaction kinds and actor roles are identified (e-TRT and Subject-Actor table are used to summarize the found transactions and actors). [Third step]( https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/oer-analysis/OER-Step3.pdf) consist of composition of the essential model – Interaction Structure Diagram in this case. Fourth step is based on validation of the previous steps (note: that’s why the directory contains only 3 files). 

## DEMO models

To capture the revealed essence of the Tax administration process the [CSD](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/demo-models/coordination_structure_diagram.pdf) and [OFD](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/blob/main/as-is-analysis/demo-models/object_fact_diagram.pdf) are used. The models are shown in the [demo-models](https://github.com/matouda7/tax-administration-digitization/tree/main/as-is-analysis/demo-models).
